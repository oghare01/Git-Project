# Git-Project
1. First Git was installed, I created a user and created a file DevOps in the Git terminal.
I then moved to the DevOps folder using the cd command. 
These steps are shown in the screenshot below

2. I created a .txt file index.txt and added a line of text to the file.
   When I tried to make my commit, I got an error. This was because I had not specified my email earlier.
   See below above steps and error message

I proceeded to specify my email and when I made the commit it worked just fine!
